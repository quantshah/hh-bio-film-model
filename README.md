# hh-bio-film-model
A variant of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations given in the paper "Ion channels enable electrical communication in bacterial communities" [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7576/full/nature15709.html]
These equations model an active potassium channel dependent on Stress (lack of nutrients) which is found to exist in bacterial Bio films. This communication channel is found to oscillate in sync with the metabolic oscillations reported for the particular cell in study.
